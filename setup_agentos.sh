# Code Standards for AgentOS Projects

## üìù CUSTOMIZATION REQUIRED
This template provides a foundation for code standards. You MUST customize it for your specific technology stack and project requirements.

## Overview
These standards ensure consistent, secure, and efficient code development across all AgentOS projects.

## Modern Development Standards

### üîß REPLACE: Update for Your Technology Stack
**Current Example: JavaScript - REPLACE WITH YOUR LANGUAGE**

#### Language-Specific Features
- **Variable Declarations**: Use `const` for immutable values, `let` for mutable variables
- **Functions**: Prefer arrow functions for concise syntax
- **Data Handling**: Use destructuring for cleaner code
- **String Handling**: Use template literals for string interpolation
- **Async Operations**: Prefer async/await over callbacks for better readability

```javascript
// EXAMPLE CODE - REPLACE WITH YOUR LANGUAGE EXAMPLES
const processUserData = async ({ userId, email, ...userData }) => {
  try {
    const validatedData = await validateInput({ userId, email, ...userData });
    const result = await UserService.save(validatedData);
    return { success: true, id: result.id };
  } catch (error) {
    Logger.error(`User processing failed: ${error.message}`);
    throw new ApplicationError('USER_PROCESS_FAILED', error.message, { userId, email });
  }
};
```

### üìã CUSTOMIZE: Error Handling Standards
**Adapt these patterns to your technology and requirements:**

#### Custom Error Classes
- Implement error types specific to your domain (UserError, DatabaseError, etc.)
- Include relevant context information in error objects
- Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures appropriate to your system
- Provide graceful degradation for non-critical failures

#### Example Error Handling Pattern:
```javascript
// CUSTOMIZE THIS PATTERN FOR YOUR TECHNOLOGY
class ProjectError extends Error {
  constructor(code, message, context = {}) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'ProjectError';
    this.code = code;
    this.context = context;
    this.timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
  }
}
```

### üîí ADAPT: Security Standards
**Modify based on your project's security requirements:**

- **Configuration Management**: Use secure configuration management appropriate for your platform
- **Input Validation**: Implement comprehensive input sanitization for your data types
- **Access Controls**: Enforce role-based access controls based on your user model
- **Audit Logging**: Maintain audit logs for all critical operations
- **Data Protection**: Ensure compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)

### üìö Documentation Standards
**Adjust documentation tools and formats for your stack:**

- **Code Documentation**: Use appropriate documentation tools for your language
- **Inline Comments**: Explain complex business logic and algorithms
- **README Files**: Maintain current documentation for each module
- **API Documentation**: Document all public interfaces using your preferred tools

### üß™ Testing Standards
**Customize testing approach for your technology and project needs:**

- **Unit Testing**: Define target coverage appropriate for your project (e.g., 80%+)
- **Integration Testing**: Test all external integrations and dependencies
- **Performance Testing**: Validate response times and resource usage for your requirements
- **Security Testing**: Implement security assessments appropriate for your threat model

2. **Frontend Technology**: [Replace with your frontend framework]
3. **Database Technology**: [Replace with your database solution]
4. **Testing Framework**: [Replace with your testing tools]
5. **Documentation Tools**: [Replace with your documentation system]
