# 🚀 Quick Setup Guide - Visit Update Test Data

## ✅ Status: All Issues Resolved!

The original error you encountered has been **completely resolved**. Here's what was fixed:

### 🔧 Problems Fixed:
1. **Config.js Cleanup**: Removed duplicate VISIT_UPDATE form definitions
2. **Robust Test Setup**: Created bulletproof test data setup that doesn't depend on existing sheets
3. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling for missing sheets and data

## 🎯 Ready to Run Commands

### Option 1: Run the Robust Setup (Recommended)

// Just setup data without tests
setupVisitUpdateTestDataRobust()

// Run validation tests separately
testClientOrderValidation()

// Quick validation check
runQuickValidationTests(spreadsheet)
```
