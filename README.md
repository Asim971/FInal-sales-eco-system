-   Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed for local development and testing tools.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/AnwarSalesEcosystem.git
    cd AnwarSalesEcosystem
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies (if any local tools are used)**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

### Basic Configuration

1.  **Google Apps Script Project**: Create a new Google Apps Script project and copy the contents of `Code.gs`, `appsscript.json`, and all `.js` files from the root directory into your Apps Script project.

2.  **Update `config.js`**: Modify the `config.js` file within your Apps Script project to include your specific Google Sheet IDs and any other relevant configurations.

    ```javascript
    // Example snippet from config.js
    const CONFIG = {
        SPREADSHEET_IDS: {
            main: 'YOUR_MAIN_SPREADSHEET_ID',
            // Add other spreadsheet IDs as needed
        },
        // ... other configurations
    };
    ```

3.  **Deploy as Web App (Optional, for external access)**:
    -   In the Google Apps Script editor, go to `Deploy > New deployment`.
    -   Select `Web app` as the type.

## 💡 Business Logic

This section details the core business logic and processes implemented within the Anwar Sales Ecosystem, focusing on how different modules interact to achieve sales and operational objectives.

### 1. Lead Management Workflow

-   **Lead Capture**: New leads are primarily captured via Google Forms. Each form submission triggers a Google Apps Script function (`onFormSubmit`) that processes the data.
-   **Data Storage**: Processed lead data is appended to a designated Google Sheet, serving as the central database for leads.
-   **Initial Contact/Notification**: Upon successful lead capture, an automated WhatsApp message is sent to the lead (if contact information is available) and/or internal sales agents, confirming receipt and initiating the sales process.
-   **Lead Assignment**: Leads can be manually or automatically assigned to sales agents based on predefined rules (e.g., geographical area, product interest) within the Google Sheet or via a dedicated script function.

### 2. Sales Process Automation

-   **Status Tracking**: Sales agents update lead statuses (e.g., "New", "Contacted", "Qualified", "Converted", "Lost") directly in the Google Sheet. Changes can trigger automated actions.
-   **Follow-up Reminders**: Scripts can be configured to send automated follow-up reminders to sales agents for leads that have been in a certain status for too long or require immediate action.
-   **Order Creation**: When a lead converts, an "order" can be generated. This might involve creating a new entry in an `Orders` sheet, updating inventory, or triggering further notifications.
-   **WhatsApp Communication**: The system facilitates two-way communication via WhatsApp for sales agents to interact with leads/customers, send product information, or confirm appointments.

### 3. Product and Inventory Management (Conceptual)

-   **Product Catalog**: A dedicated Google Sheet can store product information (SKU, name, price, description).
-   **Inventory Levels**: Inventory counts can be maintained in Google Sheets. Sales or order creation processes would ideally decrement inventory, and a separate process could handle stock replenishment.
-   **Pricing Rules**: Business logic for dynamic pricing, discounts, or promotions can be implemented within Apps Script functions that retrieve data from product sheets.

### 4. Reporting and Analytics (Conceptual)

-   **Sales Performance**: Scripts can aggregate data from lead and order sheets to generate reports on sales performance (e.g., conversion rates, sales by agent, revenue).
-   **Lead Source Analysis**: Analyze lead data to identify the most effective lead generation channels.
-   **Custom Dashboards**: Google Sheets' built-in charting and pivot table features, combined with Apps Script, can create custom dashboards for real-time insights.

### 5. Dispute Resolution Workflow

-   **Dispute Submission**: Customers or internal teams can submit disputes (e.g., order issues, service complaints) via a dedicated Google Form or direct entry into a `Disputes` Google Sheet.
-   **Categorization and Prioritization**: Disputes are categorized (e.g., "Billing", "Delivery", "Product Quality") and prioritized based on severity or impact.
-   **Resolution Tracking**: The system tracks the status of disputes (e.g., "Open", "In Progress", "Resolved", "Escalated") and assigns them to responsible personnel.
-   **Communication**: Automated notifications can be sent to relevant parties (customer, sales agent, support team) at different stages of the dispute resolution process.

### 6. Employee Management (Conceptual)

-   **Employee Database**: A Google Sheet can store employee information, roles, and access levels.
-   **Performance Tracking**: Sales performance metrics can be linked to individual employees for tracking and evaluation.

### 7. Integration Points

-   **Google Forms**: Primary input for leads and disputes.
-   **Google Sheets**: Core database and reporting tool.
-   **WhatsApp API**: Real-time communication with leads and customers.
-   **Google Apps Script**: Orchestrates all business logic, data manipulation, and integrations.

This section outlines the security considerations and permission requirements for the Anwar Sales Ecosystem.

### 1. Google Apps Script Permissions

-   **Script Authorization**: When first running the script, users will be prompted to authorize:
    -   Access to Google Sheets (read/write)
    -   Access to Google Forms (read/write)
    -   Access to Google Drive (if storing files)
    -   External API access (for WhatsApp integration)

-   **Scopes**: The following OAuth scopes are required:
    ```javascript
    // Required scopes in appsscript.json
    "oauthScopes": [
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets",
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/forms",
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive",
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.external_request"
    ]
    ```

### 2. Google Sheets Access Control

-   **Sheet Permissions**: Configure sharing settings for your Google Sheets:
    -   **Viewers**: Can view but not edit
    -   **Editors**: Can edit content (assign carefully)
    -   **Owners**: Full control (limited to trusted administrators)

-   **Protect Ranges**: Use sheet protection to prevent accidental edits to critical cells/ranges:
    ```javascript
    // Example: Protect a range
    const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName('Data');
    const range = sheet.getRange('A1:D10');
    const protection = range.protect().setDescription('Protected data range');
    protection.addEditor('admin@example.com'); // Only this email can edit
    ```

### 3. API Security

-   **WhatsApp API Keys**: Store API keys securely:
    -   Never commit API keys to version control
    -   Use Apps Script's Properties Service for storage:
        ```javascript
        // Store API key
        PropertiesService.getScriptProperties().setProperty('WHATSAPP_API_KEY', 'your-api-key');
        
        // Retrieve API key
        const apiKey = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties().getProperty('WHATSAPP_API_KEY');
        ```

-   **Web App Security**: If deploying as a web app:
    -   Set appropriate access ("Anyone", "Anyone within organization", or "Only myself")
    -   Consider adding additional authentication if exposing sensitive data

### 4. Data Privacy

-   **PII Handling**: Be cautious with Personally Identifiable Information (PII):
    -   Avoid storing unnecessary PII in sheets
    -   Implement data masking if displaying sensitive information

-   **Logging**: Ensure logs don't contain sensitive data

### 5. Audit Trail

-   **Version History**: Google Sheets and Apps Script maintain version history
-   **Execution Logs**: Apps Script dashboard records all script executions
-   **Form Submission Logs**: Google Forms tracks all submissions

---

This section provides insights into the operational aspects of the Anwar Sales Ecosystem, covering monitoring, alerting, and disaster recovery.

### 1. Monitoring

-   **Google Apps Script Dashboard**: The Google Apps Script project dashboard provides basic monitoring for script executions, including:
    -   **Executions**: View recent script runs, their status (completed, failed), and duration.
    -   **Errors**: Monitor errors and stack traces for debugging.
    -   **Triggers**: Check the status and last run time of installed triggers.

-   **Google Cloud Logging (Optional)**: For more advanced monitoring and centralized logging, integrate Google Apps Script with Google Cloud Logging.
    -   **Setup**: Enable the Cloud Logging API in your Google Cloud Project associated with your Apps Script project.
    -   **Usage**: Use `console.log()` in your Apps Script code, and these logs will appear in Cloud Logging, allowing for advanced filtering, metrics, and alerts.

-   **Google Sheets Activity**: Monitor changes and access patterns in your Google Sheets via the "Last edit was..." feature and version history.

### 2. Alerting

-   **Apps Script Error Notifications**: Configure error notifications in the Apps Script project settings to receive emails for unhandled exceptions.

-   **Custom Alerting (via Notifications.js)**:
    -   Implement custom alerting mechanisms using the `notifications.js` module.
    -   **Example**: Send WhatsApp or email alerts to administrators or on-call personnel when critical errors occur (e.g., `try-catch` blocks around key business logic).

    ```javascript
    function criticalFunction() {
      try {
        // ... critical business logic ...
      } catch (e) {
        const errorMessage = `Critical Error in criticalFunction: ${e.message} Stack: ${e.stack}`;
        sendWhatsAppMessage('admin_phone_number', errorMessage); // Send alert
        // Log to Cloud Logging if integrated
        console.error(errorMessage);
        throw e; // Re-throw to ensure Apps Script logs it
      }
    }
    ```

-   **Google Cloud Monitoring (Optional)**: If using Cloud Logging, set up custom metrics and alerting policies based on log patterns (e.g., count of "ERROR" logs exceeding a threshold).

### 3. Disaster Recovery and Backup

-   **Google Drive Version History**: Google Apps Script projects and Google Sheets automatically maintain version history, allowing you to revert to previous states.

-   **Regular Backups (Manual/Scripted)**:
    -   **Codebase**: Regularly download your Apps Script project as a `.json` or `.js` file using `clasp` or the Apps Script editor.
    -   **Data**: Periodically make copies of your critical Google Sheets or export them to other formats (e.g., CSV) as a backup measure.

-   **Redundancy**: While Google's infrastructure provides high availability, consider architectural patterns for critical components if extreme resilience is required (e.g., replicating data across multiple sheets/projects, though this adds complexity).

-   **Recovery Plan**: Document a clear recovery plan that outlines steps to restore service in case of data loss or system failure, including:
    -   Steps to restore Apps Script code.
    -   Steps to restore Google Sheet data.
    -   Procedures for re-establishing triggers and web app deployments.

### 4. Performance Considerations

-   **Batch Operations**: Minimize calls to Google services (e.g., `SpreadsheetApp.getRange().getValues()`) by reading/writing data in batches.
-   **Caching**: Utilize Apps Script's Cache Service for frequently accessed, non-sensitive data to reduce redundant computations.
-   **Trigger Optimization**: Ensure triggers are efficient and only run when necessary. Avoid heavy computations within `onEdit` or `onFormSubmit` functions; delegate to time-driven triggers if possible.
-   **Execution Quotas**: Be mindful of Google Apps Script daily execution quotas. Optimize code to stay within these limits.

## 📚 API Documentation

This section provides details on the various APIs and integration points within the Anwar Sales Ecosystem. While the system primarily uses Google Apps Script for backend logic, certain functionalities can be exposed or interact with external services.

### 1. Google Apps Script Web App API

If deployed as a Web App, the Apps Script project can expose a `doPost(e)` or `doGet(e)` function, acting as a simple API endpoint.

-   **Endpoint Example**:
    ```
    https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID/exec
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID` with the actual deployment ID obtained after deploying the script as a Web App.)

-   **Authentication**:
    -   Typically handled by Google's OAuth for authenticated users.
    -   For `Anyone` access, no explicit authentication is required, but you should implement your own security measures (e.g., API keys, token validation) within the `doPost`/`doGet` functions for sensitive operations.

-   **Request Example (POST)**:
    ```json
    {
        "action": "createEngineer",
        "data": {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "email": "john.doe@example.com",
            "phone": "+1234567890"
        }
    }
    ```

-   **Response Example (JSON)**:
    ```json
    {
        "status": "success",
        "message": "Engineer created successfully",
        "id": "ENG-001"
    }
    ```

### 2. Google Forms Integration

Google Forms serve as the primary data entry points, and their submissions can be considered an implicit API.

-   **Mechanism**: Form submissions trigger the `onFormSubmitTrigger(e)` function in `triggers.js`.
-   **Data Flow**: Form data is automatically parsed and routed to the relevant business logic (e.g., `handleEngineerFormSubmit` in `engineer.js`).

### 3. WhatsApp Integration

The system integrates with WhatsApp for notifications, typically via a third-party WhatsApp Gateway or API.

-   **Function**: `sendWhatsAppMessage(to, message)` in `notifications.js`.
-   **Configuration**: API keys and endpoint URLs for the WhatsApp Gateway are managed in `config.js`.
-   **Rate Limiting**: Adhere to the rate limits imposed by your chosen WhatsApp API provider to avoid service interruptions.

### 4. Google Sheets as a Backend

Google Sheets act as the database. Direct programmatic access can be considered an API for data manipulation.

-   **Functions**: `sheets.js` provides functions like `appendRow()`, `findRow()`, `updateRow()`.
-   **Access**: Requires Google Apps Script permissions or service account access if interacting from external applications.

### API Best Practices

-   **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and meaningful error responses.
-   **Input Validation**: Always validate incoming data to prevent malformed requests and security vulnerabilities.
-   **Security**: Protect sensitive endpoints with appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms.
-   **Logging**: Log API requests and responses for debugging and auditing purposes.

This section outlines the recommended development workflow for contributing to the Anwar Sales Ecosystem project.

### 1. Version Control (Git)

-   **Repository**: The project uses Git for version control, hosted on GitHub (or a similar platform).
-   **Branching Strategy**: We follow a simplified Git Flow or GitHub Flow:
    -   `main` (or `master`): Represents the stable, production-ready code.
    -   `develop`: Integration branch for new features and bug fixes.
    -   `feature/your-feature-name`: Branches for new features, branched off `develop`.
    -   `bugfix/issue-description`: Branches for bug fixes, branched off `develop`.

### 2. Local Development Setup

While Google Apps Script runs in the cloud, local development can be facilitated using tools like `clasp` (Google Apps Script CLI).

1.  **Install `clasp`**:

    ```bash
    npm install -g @google/clasp
    ```

2.  **Login to `clasp`**:

    ```bash
    clasp login
    ```

3.  **Clone the Apps Script Project (if starting fresh)**:

    ```bash
    clasp clone <SCRIPT_ID>
    ```

4.  **Push/Pull Code**:

    ```bash
    clasp pull   # Pull latest changes from Apps Script project
    clasp push   # Push local changes to Apps Script project
    ```

### 3. Contribution Guidelines

1.  **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the main repository to your personal GitHub account.
2.  **Create a New Branch**: Always work on a new feature or bugfix branch, never directly on `develop` or `main`.
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop
    git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
    ```
3.  **Code Changes**: Implement your changes, adhering to the coding standards (see below).
4.  **Test Your Changes**: Ensure all existing tests pass and add new tests for your changes (see [Testing](#testing)).
5.  **Commit Messages**: Write clear, concise commit messages. Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification if possible (e.g., `feat: add new user registration module`, `fix: resolve order processing bug`).
6.  **Push to Your Fork**: Push your branch to your forked repository.
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/my-new-feature
    ```
7.  **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Open a Pull Request from your feature branch to the `develop` branch of the main repository.
    -   Provide a descriptive title and detailed description of your changes.
    -   Reference any related issues.

## 🧪 Testing Improvements

This section outlines potential improvements and best practices for testing within the Anwar Sales Ecosystem.

### 1. Unit Testing

-   **Current State**: The project includes several `test-*.js` files (e.g., <mcfile name="test-visit.js" path="e:\Anwar_sales_eco\Inidividual-script\AnwarSalesEcosystem\test-visit.js"></mcfile>, <mcfile name="test-triggers.js" path="e:\Anwar_sales_eco\Inidividual-script\AnwarSalesEcosystem\test-triggers.js"></mcfile>) which serve as basic functional tests.
-   **Improvements**:
    -   **Dedicated Testing Framework**: Integrate a lightweight JavaScript testing framework (e.g., [QUnit](https://qunitjs.com/), [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)) that can run within the Apps Script environment or be adapted for local execution.
    -   **Mocking/Stubbing**: Implement mocking or stubbing for external dependencies (e.g., Google Sheets, external APIs) to isolate unit tests and ensure faster, more reliable execution.
    -   **Test Coverage**: Aim for higher test coverage, especially for critical business logic functions.

### 2. Integration Testing

-   **Focus**: Verify the interaction between different modules and external services (Google Sheets, Google Forms, WhatsApp API).
-   **Strategy**:
    -   **End-to-End Scenarios**: Create tests that simulate full user journeys (e.g., form submission -> data processing -> notification sending).
    -   **Dedicated Test Environment**: Use a separate Google Sheet and Google Form for integration tests to avoid polluting production data.
    -   **Automated Triggers**: Ensure automated triggers (e.g., `onFormSubmit`, `onEdit`) are correctly invoked and handle data as expected.

### 3. Test Execution

-   **Local Execution**: For unit tests, consider setting up a local environment using `clasp` and a Node.js-based test runner to enable faster feedback loops during development.
-   **CI/CD Integration**: Explore options for integrating tests into a Continuous Integration pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automatically run tests on every push or pull request.

### 4. Code Coverage Reporting

-   **Tooling**: Investigate tools that can generate code coverage reports for JavaScript, even if it requires some adaptation for the Apps Script environment.
-   **Benefits**: Helps identify untested parts of the codebase and encourages comprehensive testing.

### 5. Browser Compatibility (for `index.html`)

-   If `index.html` or any other client-side components are used, ensure cross-browser compatibility testing.
-   **Tools**: Use browser developer tools or dedicated testing services (e.g., BrowserStack) to verify functionality across different browsers and devices.

### Example Test Structure (Conceptual)

```javascript
// In a test file, e.g., test-engineer.js
