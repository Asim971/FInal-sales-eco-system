# Context Engineering Framework

## Overview
The Context Engineering Framework provides structured methodologies for capturing, managing, and distributing contextual information across all agents in the project workflow.

## Framework Architecture

### Context Categories

#### 1. Business Context
- Domain knowledge and business processes
- Stakeholder requirements and objectives
- Success metrics and quality standards
- Compliance and regulatory requirements

#### 2. Technical Context
- Platform constraints and limitations
- Architecture decisions and patterns
- Technology stack and integrations
- Performance and security requirements

#### 3. Project Context
- Development methodology and workflow
- Team structure and responsibilities
- Timeline and milestone planning
- Resource allocation and constraints

## Context Engineering Process

### Phase 1: Context Identification
- Identify all relevant context sources
- Categorize context by type and relevance
- Establish context priorities and dependencies
- Define context validation criteria

### Phase 2: Context Capture
- Gather context from multiple sources
- Document context in structured formats
- Validate context accuracy and completeness
- Establish context maintenance procedures

### Phase 3: Context Distribution
- Package context for agent consumption
- Implement context delivery mechanisms
- Monitor context usage and effectiveness
- Update context based on feedback

## Quality Assurance

### Context Validation
- Multi-source verification
- Stakeholder confirmation
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Consistency checking

### Continuous Improvement
- Regular context reviews and updates
- Feedback integration and analysis
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Best practice development and sharing
