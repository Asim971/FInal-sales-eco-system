# Task Analysis Template

## Overview
This template provides a structured approach for analyzing tasks within the project, ensuring comprehensive understanding and effective execution aligned with project standards.

## Task Analysis Framework

### 1. Initial Task Assessment

#### Task Understanding
```
**Task Title**: [Brief, descriptive title]
**Task Category**: [Development | Enhancement | Bug Fix | Documentation]
**Priority Level**: [High | Medium | Low]
**Estimated Complexity**: [Simple | Moderate | Complex]
**Dependencies**: [List any prerequisites]
```

#### Context Analysis
```
**Business Context**: 
- What business problem does this task solve?
- How does it align with project mission?
- What is the expected business impact?

**Technical Context**:
- Which system components are affected?
- What existing functionality needs modification?
- Are there any technical constraints?

**User Impact**:
- Who are the end users affected?
- How will this improve user experience?
- Any potential risks to consider?
```

### 2. Requirements Analysis

#### Functional Requirements
```
**Core Functionality**:
1. [Requirement 1 - specific, measurable]
2. [Requirement 2 - specific, measurable]
3. [Requirement 3 - specific, measurable]

**Input/Output Specifications**:
- Input: [Data format, validation rules]
- Processing: [Business logic, transformations]
- Output: [Expected results, format]
```

#### Non-Functional Requirements
```
**Performance**:
- Response time targets
- Throughput requirements
- Resource constraints

**Security**:
- Data protection requirements
- Access control needs
- Compliance considerations

**Reliability**:
- Error handling requirements
- Fallback mechanisms
- Recovery procedures
```

### 3. Implementation Planning

#### Technical Approach
```
**Development Strategy**:
1. [Step 1 - specific action]
2. [Step 2 - specific action]
3. [Step 3 - specific action]

**Risk Assessment**:
- Technical risks and mitigation
- Business risks and impact
- Dependencies and blockers

**Testing Strategy**:
- Unit testing approach
- Integration testing needs
- Acceptance criteria
```

### 4. Quality Assurance

#### Acceptance Criteria
```
**Functional Criteria**:
- [ ] [Criterion 1 - specific, testable]
- [ ] [Criterion 2 - specific, testable]
- [ ] [Criterion 3 - specific, testable]

**Technical Criteria**:
- [ ] Code follows established standards
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Security measures implemented
- [ ] Documentation complete
```
