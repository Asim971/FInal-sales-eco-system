# Order Dispute Notification System

## Overview
This feature automatically sends dispute notifications to appropriate personnel when an order is created with engineer or partner requirements set to "No". This helps ensure proper oversight and dispute handling for orders that may require additional review.

## Notification Logic

### When Engineer Required = "No"
- **Who gets notified**: All employees with role "BDO" (Business Development Officer)
- **Purpose**: BDO can review if the order actually needs engineer services and submit a dispute if necessary
- **Message Type**: Engineer Dispute Notification

### When Partner/Contractor Required = "No"  
- **Who gets notified**: All employees with role "CRO" (Customer Relations Officer)
- **Purpose**: CRO can review if the order actually needs partner/contractor services and submit a dispute if necessary
- **Message Type**: Partner Dispute Notification

### When Both Are Set to "No"
- **Result**: Both BDO and CRO receive their respective dispute notifications
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive review by both teams

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **order.js** - Added dispute notification logic to `sendOrderNotifications()` function
2. **test-order-dispute.js** - Test cases for the new functionality

### New Functions Added

#### `sendDisputeNotifications(orderData, potentialSiteInfo, submitterEmployee)`
- Main function that checks engineer/partner requirements and sends appropriate notifications
- Looks up BDO and CRO employees using `findEmployeesByRole()`
- Sends WhatsApp notifications to relevant personnel

#### `createDisputeNotificationMessage(orderData, potentialSiteInfo, submitterEmployee, disputeType, reason)`
- Creates formatted dispute notification messages
- Includes order details, project information, and action required
- Different messages for engineer vs partner disputes

### Integration Points
- Automatically triggered when `handleOrderFormSubmit()` processes new orders
- Uses existing WhatsApp notification system (`sendWhatsAppMessage()`)
- Leverages existing employee lookup functions (`findEmployeesByRole()`)

## Message Format

```

### Partner Dispute Notification (to CRO)
Similar format but with ü§ù emoji and "Partner/Contractor" terminology.

## Testing

### Test File: `test-order-dispute.js`
Contains comprehensive test cases:
1. Engineer Required = "No" (BDO notification)
2. Partner Required = "No" (CRO notification)  
3. Both = "No" (Both BDO and CRO notifications)
4. Both = "Yes" (No dispute notifications)
5. Message formatting tests

### Running Tests
```javascript
// In Apps Script Editor
runOrderDisputeTests();
```

## Configuration Requirements

### Employee Data Setup
- Employees must be properly configured in the EMPLOYEES sheet
- BDO employees must have role = "BDO"
- CRO employees must have role = "CRO"
- WhatsApp numbers must be populated for notifications to work

### Form Configuration
The ORDER_CREATION form must include:
- "Is Engineer Required?" - Multiple choice: ['Yes', 'No']
- "Is Partner/Contractor Required?" - Multiple choice: ['Yes', 'No']

## Error Handling
- Graceful handling when no BDO/CRO employees are found
- Logging of all notification attempts and failures
- Continues processing even if notifications fail
- Individual error handling for each notification recipient

## Future Enhancements
1. Territory-based dispute routing (send to BDO/CRO in specific territories)
2. Escalation timers (auto-escalate if no response within X hours)
3. Integration with actual dispute creation workflow
4. Analytics on dispute notification frequency by territory/order type
