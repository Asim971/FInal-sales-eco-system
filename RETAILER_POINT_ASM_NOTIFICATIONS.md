   - Must have valid email addresses
   - WhatsApp numbers required for notifications

2. **ASM Employees**:
   - Must have role = "ASM"
   - Must have company field set to "ACL" or "AIL"
   - Must have territory field matching request territories
   - WhatsApp numbers required for notifications

### Form Configuration
The RETAILER_POINT_REQUEST form includes:

  'Location', 'Select Company', 'Status', 'ASM Notes', 
  'Approval Date', 'Notes'
]
```

## Error Handling & Fallbacks
